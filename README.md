# BankProject

This repo is for creating a Bank project example, mainly using FastAPI, MongoDB, and Next.js.

## Project Description

This project is a web application that simulates bank accounts with cryptocurrency features. Users can register, log in, view their account balances, deposit money, and purchase cryptocurrencies using their deposited funds. The application provides a seamless experience by integrating modern frontend and backend technologies, ensuring secure transactions and efficient data handling.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building the user interface with server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.
- **Python**: The programming language used for backend development.

### Database
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user data, account balances, and transaction histories.
- **Motor**: An asynchronous Python driver for MongoDB.

### Authentication & Security
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication and authorization.
- **bcrypt**: A password-hashing function for securely storing user passwords.
- **PyJWT**: A Python library for encoding and decoding JWT tokens.

### External Services
- **CoinGecko API**: For fetching real-time cryptocurrency prices.

### Containerization & Deployment
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Docker Compose**: For orchestrating multiple Docker containers.

### Other
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Used in the backend for improved performance.
- **Environment Variables**: For managing configuration settings securely.
- **CORS Middleware**: Configured in FastAPI for cross-origin resource sharing.

## Key Features

1. **User Registration and Authentication**
   - Secure user signup with password hashing
   - Login functionality with JWT token session management

2. **Account Management**
   - View account details (cash balance and cryptocurrency holdings)
   - Deposit funds into the account

3. **Cryptocurrency Transactions**
   - Real-time fetching of cryptocurrency prices
   - Purchasing cryptocurrencies using available cash balance

4. **Responsive UI**
   - Interactive and user-friendly interface with React components
   - Server-side rendering for improved performance

## Potential Future Enhancements

- Support for additional cryptocurrencies and advanced trading features
- Detailed transaction history
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Secure HTTPS communication with SSL certificates
- Caching mechanisms for improved performance
- Load balancing and horizontal scaling (e.g., using Kubernetes)
- Automated testing (unit and integration tests)
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Summary

This project combines a modern tech stack to build a full-featured web application simulating banking and cryptocurrency functionalities. By leveraging Next.js, FastAPI, and MongoDB, it ensures a robust and scalable platform. Dockerization facilitates easy deployment and environment consistency, making it suitable for both development and production stages.
